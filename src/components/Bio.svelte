I actually have no specialties and have no problem using whatever's being thrown at me to make something worthwile and usable. This includes reinventing the wheel for a simple Arduino project, committing myself to make stupid gameplay compilation videos every single month, running a meme group full of niche memes, literally compiling Tailwind component into a website which looks like a single step from WWW-era sites, making <a class="link link-primary" href="https://github.com/dulapahv/Kanbaru">an actual software</a> and more.</p>
